"""
yalib is an assorted collection of Pythonic stuff that is too trivial for a project of its own yet is not trivial enough to duplicate for each 'real' project. See docstrings, where they exist, for more info.

The code in the 'alien' sub-package of yalib was written by other authors and is included verbatim or with few changes for convenience.
